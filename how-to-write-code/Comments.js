   // This demo shows off comments! I can type here without any issues

   // console.log("This does not print."); but what about here? Is there a way to do like a shortcut to the file destination when I start my terminal?

   console.log("Hello, World!"); // Comments do not have to start at the beginning of a line.

   /* Here is how
   to have
   multi-line
   comments. */

   console.log("Comments make your code more readable by others.");
